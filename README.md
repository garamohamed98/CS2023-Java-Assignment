# CS2023-Java-Assignment
This repository contains the code and related files for the CS2023 course's Java assignment. It's a part of our coursework for the semester, focusing on Java programming concepts and problem-solving. You'll find the source code, documentation, and any additional resources necessary to complete and understand the assignment.


**Before You Begin:** Ensure You Have Java JDK Installed

Before you dive into these exercises, make sure you have Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer. If you don't have it already, you can download and install it by following the instructions below:

1. **Install Java JDK:** If you don't have Java JDK installed, you can download it from the official Oracle website or use an open-source distribution like OpenJDK.

2. **Set Java JDK Path (if not set):** If the Java JDK path is not set, you'll need to set it. You can do this by adding the JDK's "bin" directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow you to use the `javac` and `java` commands from any directory in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Compilation:** To compile the Java code, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the .java file is located, and use the following command:
   ```shell
   javac Exercise1Solution.java
   ```
4. **Running the Code:** After successful compilation, you can run the code using the following command:
    ```shell
    java Exercise1Solution
    ```

Now that you have Java JDK installed, you're ready to proceed with the exercises.
