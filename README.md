## Code

You can find the code for each exercise in the [Lesson1](Lesson1) directory.

Feel free to click on the exercise titles to view the descriptions and explore the code for each exercise.

**Exercise Solutions:**

- [Exercise 1 Solution](Lesson1/Exercice1/Comparaison2.java): This is the Java code that provides a solution to Exercise 1.
- [Exercise 2 Solution](Lesson1/Exercice2/Comparaison3.java): This is the Java code that provides a solution to Exercise 2.
- [Exercise 3 Solution](Lesson1/Exercice3/Equation2.java): This is the Java code that provides a solution to Exercise 3.
- [Exercise 4 Solution](Lesson1/Exercice4/TestPremier.java): This is the Java code that provides a solution to Exercise 4.
- [Exercise 5 Solution](Lesson1/Exercice5/ListePremier.java): This is the Java code that provides a solution to Exercise 5.
- [Exercise 6 Solution](Lesson1/Exercice5/Factorielle1.java): This is the Java code that provides a solution to Exercise 6 question 1.
- [Exercise 6 Solution](Lesson1/Exercice5/Factorielle2.java): This is the Java code that provides a solution to Exercise 6 question 2.

## Using the Exercise Solutions

To use the exercise solutions, you'll need to have the Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer. Here are the steps to set the Java JDK path, compile, and run the Java code:

1. **Install Java JDK:** If you don't have Java JDK installed, you can download it from the official Oracle website or use an open-source distribution like OpenJDK.

2. **Set Java JDK Path (if not set):** If the Java JDK path is not set, you'll need to set it. You can do this by adding the JDK's "bin" directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow you to use the `javac` and `java` commands from any directory in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Compilation:** To compile the Java code, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the .java file is located, and use the following command:
   ```shell
   javac Exercise1Solution.java
   ```
4. **Running the Code:** After successful compilation, you can run the code using the following command:
    ```shell
    java Exercise1Solution
    ```

Happy coding!
